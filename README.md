## Customer Churn Analysis - Banking Domain
 Objective: 
 To analyze and identify key drivers of customer churn in a retail banking environment and visualize
 actionable insights using Power BI for strategic retention planning.
 
 Project Summary:
 This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior using demographic, transactional, and
 engagement data from a fictional banking dataset. The goal was to identify patterns and factors influencing
 customer exits and build a dynamic Power BI dashboard for business stakeholders.
 
 Tools & Technologies:- Power BI - Interactive dashboards, DAX, slicers- SQL - Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation- Excel - Preprocessing and data validation
 
 Data Sources Used:- ActiveCustomer- Bank_Churn- CreditCard- CustomerInfo- ExitCustomer- Gender- Geography
 
 Key KPIs Tracked:- Total Customers- Active vs. Inactive Customers- Credit Card vs. Non-Credit Card Holders- Exit vs. Retained Customers- Churn Rate % (by Year and Month)- Exit Customers by:

 Insights Derived:- High Churn in Early Tenure: Majority of exits observed within 3-5 years of tenure.- Geographic Risk: France and Spain had the highest churn rates, indicating region-specific trends.- Credit Card Retention: Customers with credit cards were more likely to stay, showing strong product
 influence.- Customer Type Impact: Inactive members showed a significantly higher churn ratio.- Credit Score Linkage: Customers with lower credit scores (Fair and Poor) exited more frequently.

 Dashboard Features:- Slicers for Year, Month, Geography, Product Usage, Membership Type, Exit Category- Yearly & Monthly churn trends visualized using line and bar charts- Churn % heatmap table for quick temporal comparison- Drill-down capability for detailed demographic & behavioral segmentation
 Outcome & Business Value:- Helped the hypothetical bank identify at-risk segments and build retention strategies.- Enabled quick decision-making via a dynamic and intuitive dashboard.- Provided stakeholders with deep visibility into key churn drivers, helping prioritize customer loyalty
